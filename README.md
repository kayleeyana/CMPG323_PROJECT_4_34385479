## What is RPA and Automation all about?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that employs software robots to replicate human tasks, focusing on automating interactions with user interfaces to handle repetitive and time-consuming processes. RPA serves as a catalyst for organizations to optimize operational efficiency by delegating routine, rule-based tasks to these digital assistants, thus enabling human workers to channel their efforts into more strategic and creative endeavors. The merits of RPA are diverse, encompassing cost savings, heightened precision, expedited task execution, and scalable deployment, all with minimal disruption to existing systems. RPA stands as a transformative force in reshaping business operations, elevating productivity, and liberating employees to engage in more strategic and value-driven tasks, thereby streamlining processes and elevating overall performance.

# Why we need Automation in our lives?

SAVE TIME, MONEY AND THERES STILL MORE TO COME...

# HOW TO USE THE AUTOMATION:

This Automation populates the: Customers, Orders, Products, and OrdersDetails using the Excel spreadsheet called "ecopowerlogistics" and displays all the data on the web app called: https://cmpg323-ecopowerlogistics.azurewebsites.net/

# More about the RPA and Testing.

Firstly the automation logs into the web app called https://cmpg323-ecopowerlogistics.azurewebsites.net/ with a username and password saved in the automation.
Following this it clicks on the "Create New" proceeding with entering all the data from the excel spreadsheet onto the webpage and automates all records for the: Customers, Orders,Products, OrdersDetails after it clicks "Create" for each tab: Customers,Orders,OrdersDetails and Products.

It then displays all records for Customers, Orders,Products, OrdersDetails in a Table Form.
